# Mining-Mario-25

This is a game which is solely created by me. I have heavily used jQuery in it with basic html, css and color & sound tweaking. Instructions and concepts of this game is provided in the welcome page itself.
I will recommend to move game folder in the localhost and hop on to localhost/game to enjoy the rich experience.

Known Bugs:
* sound files are not compressed.

Known Improvements: 
* To add congratulations message on level complete.
* Add background music to the game-end.
